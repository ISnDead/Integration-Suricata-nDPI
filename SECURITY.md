## Reporting security vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT file a public issue**, instead send your report privately to tinyksob@gmail.com.

Security reports are greatly appreciated, and we will publicly thank you for it (if you want to). We also love sending gifts, if you like it, then let us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future.
